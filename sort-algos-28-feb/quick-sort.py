"""
How quick sort works:
- A pivot is chosen(I.e. mean of three):
    - The first, middle and last elements of the list are identified
    - The identified items are sorted properly and the middle one is estimated to be close to the middle of the list
- An item from the left is chosen, which is the first one that is larger than the pivot
- An item from the right is chosen, whichis the first on that is smaller than the pivot
- Switch these two items that have been selected
- Repeat the process until the item from left has a greater index than the item from the left
- Swap the item from the left with the pivot
- The two separate lists on either side of the pivot are isolated and have the process above perfomed on them recursively



A pivot is an item in the final sorted array that:
- Has a correct position
- All the items to the left are smaller
- All the items to the right are larger
